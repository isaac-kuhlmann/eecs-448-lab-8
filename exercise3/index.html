            Damian Lillard is an NBA basketball player for the Portland Trail-Blazers.
            He is a 6'3" Point Guard whose main focus of the game is scoring.
            This is unusual for point guards, who generally focus their style of game more
            towards distributing the ball to their teammates and accumulating assists instead of points.
            However, Lillard has become a true master at getting the ball through the hoop. Despite being
            only half-way through his hopefully long career, he is rapidly clossing on many records for the Trail Blazers.

            A couple of these records have already been broken. One such record is the most points
            scored by a Portland Trail Blazer in a single game. This was actually broken in this year
            of 2020, so not everything has been so terrible! Lillard put on a 61 point outing against
            the Golden State Warriors on January 1st, 2020. Along with this, he also broke the Trail
            Blazers record for most 3 pointers made in a single season. As a longtime fan of Damian
            Lillard, I hope this is a sign of much more to come from this incredible talent.
